    <div paragraph>
      I'm a computer science student with a sharp focus on full-stack development, object-oriented programming, and
      creating real-world solutions with clean, scalable code. With a solid command of C++, Java, and JavaScript, I
      bring
      a balanced mix of backend logic and frontend finesse. My journey through engineering has been guided by curiosity,
      an obsession with clarity in code, and a minimalist approach to UI and user experience.

      As a full-stack JavaScript developer, I've built applications using modern frameworks like React, Next.js, and
      Node.js. My projects integrate cloud deployments, payment APIs, and ML-powered features using OpenCV and
      MediaPipeâ€”all supported by well-tested code and structured design patterns. I focus not just on functionality but
      on
      performance, security, and thoughtful user interaction.

      Beyond the code, I've led developer workshops, mentored peers, and driven projects as a technical lead in my
      university's coding community. I believe in open collaboration, continuous improvement, and leveraging theoryâ€”from
      UML to shell scriptingâ€”to write resilient software.

      When I'm not building, I explore system design, DevOps workflows, and minimalist product design. I thrive on
      learning, solving, and refining. With adaptability and a strong analytical mindset, I aim to contribute to teams
      that value quality, precision, and user-first thinking.
